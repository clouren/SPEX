Default instalation locations:

    include
    lib
    share
    
To compile SPEX and its dependencies, just type cd to the SPEX folder and 
type "make"
This will also run a few short demos
To install the package system-wide, copy the `lib/*` to /usr/local/lib,
and copy `include/*` to /usr/local/include.
