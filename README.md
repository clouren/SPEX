Dependencies of SPEX:

    AMD                 approximate minimum degree ordering

    COLAMD              column approximate minimum degree ordering

    SuiteSparse_config  configuration for all of SuiteSparse

    GNU GMP             GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library
                        for big integer operations

    GNU MPFR            GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable
                        Library for arbitrary precision floating point
                        operations

Default 'local' instalation locations:

    include
    lib
    bin

To compile SPEX and its dependencies, a very simple top-level Makefile
is provided.  All it does is use cmake to build each of the packages.

    Makefile    to compile all of SPEX and its dependencies

                make            compiles SuiteSparse libraries.
                                Subsequent "make install" will install
                                in just /usr/local/lib.
                                Normally requires "sudu make install"

                make local      compiles SuiteSparse.
                                Subsequent "make install will install only
                                in ./lib, ./include only.  No sudo required.
                                Does not install in /usr/local/lib.

                make global     compiles SuiteSparse libraries.
                                Subsequent "make install" will install in
                                just /usr/local/lib (or whatever your
                                CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is).
                                Normally requires "sudu make install"
                                Does not install in ./lib and ./include.

                make install    installs in the current directory
                                (./lib, ./include), and/or in
                                /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include,
                                depending on whether "make", "make local",
                                "make global", or "make both",
                                etc has been done.

                make demos      run a few short demos

                make uninstall  undoes 'make install'

                make distclean  removes all files not in distribution, including
                                ./bin, ./lib, and ./include.

                make purge      same as 'make distclean'

                make clean      removes all files not in distribution, but
                                keeps compiled libraries and demoes, ./lib
                                and ./include.

You can set specific options for CMake with the command (for example):

    CMAKE_OPTIONS="-DNSTATIC=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" make

That command will compile all of SPEX and it dependencies.
Debug mode will be used.  The static libraries will not be built
(NSTATIC is true).

    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:   Default: "Release", use "Debug" for debugging.

    GLOBAL_INSTALL:     if true, "make install" will install
                        into /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include.
                        Default: true

    LOCAL_INSTALL:      if true, "make install" will install
                        into SuiteSparse/lib and SuiteSparse/include.
                        Default: false

    NSTATIC:            if true, static libraries are not built.
                        Default: false, except for GraphBLAS, which
                        takes a long time to compile so the default for
                        GraphBLAS is true.  For Mongoose, the NSTATIC setting
                        is treated as if it always false, since the mongoose
                        program is built with the static library.

    NOPENMP             if true: OpenMP is not used.  Default: false.
                        Only used by SuiteSparse_config.

    DEMO                if true: build the demo programs for each package.
                        Default: false.

You can also use cmake or ccmake directly.  For example, try:

    cd AMD/build
    ccmake ..
    make
