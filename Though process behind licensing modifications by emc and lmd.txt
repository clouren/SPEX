Utils - Basis of everything   - C,E,T,J
LU    - Basis of everything   - C,E,T,J
Chol  - Needs utils, part of the code is simply modified LU - C,E,T,L, <-- 'J'
QR    - Needs utils, "structuraly" same, but the core functions are distinct  - C,E,T,L
Update - Depends on LU/Chol - J,T, <---'E,C' (but fine if they exclude E---Chris?), ---> "L" (fine if they include you)
Back - Depends on everything - True transitivity - ALL
