Example matrices for SPEX demos and testing.

FIXME: make all these matrices 1-based.

FIXME: there are empty files here.  What are they?

FIXME: some files are called "soln".  Why? They are used as RHS, not solutions.
    some are called "_v" ... what is that?

FIXME: duplicates:  These files are identical.  Delete one:
    872_mat.txt
    872.mat.txt

FIXME: describe each pair of files.  Unclear where they come from.
    Is 1328 the ssget matrix with id == 1328?  If so, it has the
    wrong name.  Use the right name.
