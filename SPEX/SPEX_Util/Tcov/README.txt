SLIP_LU/Tcov:  comprehensive test coverage for SLIP LU.  Requires Linux.
Type "make" to compile, and then "make run" to run the tests.
The test coverage is in cover.out.  The test output is
printed on stdout, except for cov_test (which prints its output in various
*.out files).

If the test is successful, the last line printed should be
"statements not yet tested: 0", and all printed residuals should be small.
