THIS IS DEVELOPMENTAL CODE, IT IS NOT INTENDED TO YET BE USED 
BY PRACTITIONERS. IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE A LINEAR SYSTEM EXACTLY
USE SPEX_LEFT_LU
*************************************************************

SPEX_Cholesky is a code for exactly solving sparse SPD
linear systems. It comprises both an integer-preserving
up-looking and integer-preserving left-looking Cholesky
factorization.

SPEX_Cholesky is a component of the SParse EXact software
package. Its dependencies are the same as SPEX.
