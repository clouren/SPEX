Demo: 
    FIXME too many duplicated deom functions.  Use a single demo folder?
        Or at least let Demos share code with other demos.
    FIXME: demos should be renamed to be consistent.  There is no "example1".
        Name them "spex_lu_demo1,2,3...", spex_update_demo1,2, perhaps.
    FIXME: demos should not refer to default filenames.  Defaults should be
        stdin if a single matrix, or no defaults if 2 files required.
        Default file names assume the demo is run in a particular folder,
        which is awkward with the new cmake structure.
    FIXME: demo files have more than one function per file;
        makes it hard to find, share with other demos, etc.  Split them.

Lorena:
    rename demos.c files to give them unique names
    remove test files from SPEX_Update; just keep a few
    ExampleMats: consolidate

later:
    remove Update folder for SPEX 3.0.0, add back for SPEX 3.1.0
    remove SPEX_QR for SPEX 3.0.0.
    SPEX_Update for v3.1.0: how to create vk or w

    user guide: state that SPEX_initialize cannot be called by multiple
        user threads.  Just one.
        later: copy in user guide from Overleaf

    see other FIXMEs in the code

Erick:
    licence folder
    copyright dates (wait for Chris to ask USNA)
        (Note from Tim: Chris says USNA is OK and copyright belongs to him)

in parallel:
    user guide polish (see Overleaf)
    add SPEX_gmp_initialize and SPEX_gmp_finalize to the user guide;
        see them in SPEX_gmp.[ch]
