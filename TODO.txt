Thread-safety:  Test with multiple user threads

Demo:

    FIXME: rename SPEX_print_options, etc to spex_demo_print_options ...
        Do not call demo functions "SPEX_whatever", because they are not
        user-callable..  They look like part of the library and the user will
        try to use them but not find them.  Call them "demo_whatever" or
        "spex_demo_whatever".

in parallel:
    user guide polish (see Overleaf)

Tim:
    cmake for Python interface
    cmake for top-level Demo folder: done but needs cleanup

user guide: state that SPEX_initialize cannot be called by multiple
    user threads.  Just one.  Discuss SPEX_thread_initialize and
    SPEX_thread_finalize
        later: copy in user guide from Overleaf

lots of FIXMEs in the code


later:
    dig up LPnetlib test files (to add for SPEX 3.1.0, then clean up)
    remove Update folder for SPEX 3.0.0, add back for SPEX 3.1.0
    remove SPEX_QR for SPEX 3.0.0., add back for SPEX 3.1.0
    remove Update from v3.0.0 user guide, add back for SPEX 3.1.0
    SPEX_Update for v3.1.0: how to create vk or w
