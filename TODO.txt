    spex.h: should we have a master Include folder? Yes.
    rename demos.c files to give them unique names
    remove test files from SPEX_Update; just keep a few
    ExampleMats: consolidate

later:
    remove Update folder for SPEX 3.0.0, add back for SPEX 3.1.0
    remove SPEX_QR for SPEX 3.0.0.
    SPEX_Update for v3.1.0: how to create vk or w

    user guide: state that SPEX_initialize cannot be called by multiple
        user threads.  Just one.
        later: copy in user guide from Overleaf

    see other FIXMEs in the code

Erick:
    licence folder
    copyright dates (wait for Chris to ask USNA)

Tim:
