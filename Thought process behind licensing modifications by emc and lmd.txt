Utils - Basis of everything - C,E,T,J,L (everybody)
Demos - Use everything      - C,E,T,J,L (everybody)

LU    - Basis of everything   - C,E,T,J
Chol  - Needs utils, part of the code is simply modified LU - C,E,T,L,J
QR    - Needs utils, "structuraly" same, but the core functions are distinct  - C,E,T,L
Update - Depends on LU/Chol - C,E,T,J
Backslash - Depends on everything - C,E,T,J,L

FIXME: Erick will double-check the above, in the code.
